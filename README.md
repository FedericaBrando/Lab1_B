# README.md
--------------------

## STEP1 - HMM model build
[hmm_project directory](hmm_project/)

In this directory you'll find the [Jupyter notebook](hmm_project/buildingHMMlogo_workflow.ipynb).

by following the steps you could retrieve the hmm_logo and .hmm file that we'll use, later on.


## STEP2 - Validation and performance of the model 
[model_validation directory](model_validation/)

In this directory you'll find a [Jupyter notebook](model_validation/model_val.ipynb) with the steps to perform the validation of
 [HMM model](hmm_project/kunitz_newlogo.hmm) created in the first step. 

Database file for **not Kunitz** proteins was too big to be uploaded on git, therefore you could download it by using
 the same query used to retrieved them. More details in the  [Jupyter notebook](model_validation/model_val.ipynb).
